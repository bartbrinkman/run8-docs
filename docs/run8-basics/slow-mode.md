# Slow mode

"Slow mode" on a US freight locomotive, often referred to as "yard mode" or "switching mode," is a feature that modifies the locomotive's operational characteristics to make it more suitable for low-speed, precise movements, such as those required when assembling trains in a rail yard or performing switching operations. In Run8, slow mode by default 3 mph (4.35 km/h).
